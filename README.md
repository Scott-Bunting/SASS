# Social Anxiety Sensing System (SASS)

This repository contains code, data, documents, research, images and everything and anything else relevant to the development of this project.  
Each category of information is stored in an accordingly labelled directory.

## Objective

Develop a Social Anxiety Sensing System. A wearable which can read, learn and detect Social Anxiety in users.  

## Hardware

A variety of hardware is being used in the development of this project.  
The initial phases will be limited to rapid prototyping techniques, with potential to delve into more application specific electronics at a later stage. 
*This section will be updated as hardware requirements change and the project progresses*  
*Additionally, this section will be separated into respective phases of prototyping*
*Links should be attached to the sensors and devices*

**Phase 1 - Lab/Bench Prototyping**

* Arduino Uno
* MAX9814 Microphone Amplifier
* HC-05 Bluetooth RF Transceiver
* MPU-6050-3 axis Gyroscope and Accelerometer
* MAX86160EFN+ PPG and Pulse-Oximetry
* Grove GSR Sensor

## Software

Alike the Hardware, Software varies depending on the phase.  
The earlier phases being limited to high-level, rapid prototyping code and libraries.  
If more application specific software is required, this will be incorporated at later stages in the project.

**Phase 1 - Lab/Bench Prototyping**

* Arduino Code
